Something must've gone wrong in my brain
<br>Got your chemicals all in my veins
<br>Feeling all the highs, feel all the pain
<br>Let go on the wheel, it's the bullet lane
<br>Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
<br>Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

<br><br> Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
<br>Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
<br>All I need, yeah, you're all I need

<br><br>It's you, babe
<br>And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
<br>And I could try to run, but it would be useless
<br>You're to blame
<br>Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
<br>It's you, babe
<br>And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
<br>And I could try to run, but it would be useless
<br>You're to blame
<br>Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

<br><br>I'll never be the same
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>Never be the same

<br><br>Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
<br>Off of one touch, I could overdose
<br>You said, "Stop playing it safe
<br>Boy, I wanna see you lose control"

<br><br>Just like nicotine, (nicotine) heroin, morphine (morphine)
<br>Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need (all I need)
<br>All I need, yeah, you're all I need

<br><br>It's you, babe
<br>And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
<br>And I could try to run, but it would be useless
<br>You're to blame
<br>Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
<br>It's you, babe
<br>And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
<br>And I could try to run, but it would be useless
<br>You're to blame, you're to blame
<br>Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

<br><br><br>I'll never be the same
<br>Never be the same, girl
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>And now

<br><br>You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
<br>You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

<br><br>It's you, babe
<br><br>And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
<br>And I could try to run, but it would be useless
<br>You're to blame (you're to blame)
<br>Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
<br>It's you, babe
<br>And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
<br>And I could try to run, but it would be useless
<br>You're to blame, you're to blame
<br>Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same
