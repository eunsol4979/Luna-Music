It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
<br>You're like a broken home to me
<br>I take a shot of memories
<br>And black out like an empty street
<br>I fill my days with the way you walk
<br>Like one day you'll come back to me

<br><br>Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
<br>I'm just depressed that you're gone
<br>Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

<br><br>Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
<br>She's naked in my bed
<br>And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
<br>I wouldn't take 'em back
<br>I'm in love with the past
<br>And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

<br><br>Nah-nah-nah, in my head
<br>Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
<br>Nah-nah-nah, ayy
<br>Makin' beautiful mistakes

<br><br>It's pitiful, I can't believe
<br>How every day gets worse for me
<br>I take a break, I cut you off
<br>To keep myself from lookin' soft
<br>I fill my nights with the way you was
<br>And still wake up with broken dreams
<br>I make these lies inside my head
<br>Feel like they're my reality

<br><br>Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
<br>I'm just depressed that you're gone
<br>Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

<br><br>Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
<br>She's naked in my bed
<br>And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
<br>I wouldn't take 'em back
<br>I'm in love with the past
<br>And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

<br><br>Nah-nah-nah, in my head
<br>Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
<br>Nah-nah-nah (ayy, ayy)
<br>Makin' beautiful mistakes

<br><br>You did me wrong 'cause I let you (let you)
<br>Usually, I like my situations beneficial
<br>Doin' somethin' different, got me lookin' stupid (damn)
<br>The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreamin', lucid
<br>Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (keep it)
<br>Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
<br>But really I was doin' just fine without ya
<br>Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (ah)
<br>Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Like you don't need me)
<br>Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
<br>How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
<br>You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)

<br><br>Yeah, bet you miss my love all in your bed (bed)
<br>Now you're stressin' out, pullin' your hair (hair)
<br>Smellin' your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
<br>Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (sad)
<br>I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
<br>Best you ever had and best you gon' get (gon' get)
<br>And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (be friends)
<br>You're toxic

<br><br>Beautiful mistakes, I make inside my head
<br>She's naked in my bed
<br>And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
<br>I wouldn't take 'em back
<br>I'm in love with the past
<br>And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

<br><br>Nah-nah-nah, in my head
<br>Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
<br>Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (oh)
<br>Makin' beautiful mistakes
<br>Nah-nah-nah, in my head
<br>Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
<br>Nah-nah-nah, ayy (let it go)
<br>Makin' beautiful mistakes

<br><br>Nah-nah-nah
<br>Nah-nah-nah (ooh)
<br>Nah-nah-nah
<br>(Mistakes)
