We are runnin' so fast
<br>And we never look back
<br>And whatever I lack, you make up
<br>We make a really good team
<br>And not everyone sees
<br>We got this crazy chemistry
<br>Between us

<br><br>Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
<br>Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
<br>Making new clichés on our own little tour
<br>Let's ride

<br><br>You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
<br>Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
<br>We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
<br>Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
<br>All I need is you
<br>All I need is you, you

<br><br>We try staying up late
<br>But we both are light weights
<br>Yeah we get off our face, too easy
<br>And we take jokes way too far
<br>And sometimes living's too hard
<br>We're like two halves of one heart
<br>We are, we are, we are

<br><br>You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
<br>Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
<br>We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
<br>Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
<br>All I need is you
<br>All I need is you, you

<br><br>Eat a pill stay and chill, you don't need to go
<br>I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
<br>I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
<br>Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
<br>Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
<br>We can get married tonight if you really wanna
<br>Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
<br>And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honor

<br><br>You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
<br>Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
<br>We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
<br>Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
<br>All I need is you
<br>All I need is you, you
